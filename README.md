## About this repo

Written by [@helenamerk](https://github.com/helenamerk), initially released inside OrangeDAO and republished for public use.

`yc-auth` is a react app that lets people signin with their bookface login. Enjoy!

`backend/src/signin-with-yc.js` is a simple script that you can take a look at and modify for your needs. If you want auth on the backend, you want to plop that logic in there somewhere.

Try out the demo here: https://3000-ycauth-vw0t-glimpse.brev.sh/

Or run the demo, `npm start` in backend (port 8080) and frontend (port 3000). Enjoy!

# DISCLAIMER

This is (1) not an official signing with YC library and (2) not for scraping any YC information. If you scrape, YOU will get banned from bookface. If you build an app that allows other to spam, they will get blocked. Do NOT publish YC data outside of bookface.
